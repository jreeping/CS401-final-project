Why is Energy Efficiency Important

Energy efficiency is specifically important for a few main reasons. First, every computer has a certain amount of wattage available to use in its power supply. Depending on how large the program is, and how many things are running at once, if you are using one of the more power intensive programming languages, you could max out a power supply if your program is extremely power intensive and the PC's power supply doesn't have sufficient overhead on 100% load. Second, electricity costs money, and decreasing the electricity usage of a program will decrease the cost of using the program. Third, energy efficiency is directly linked to the CPU usage of the program, and lower CPU usage is advantageous for many reasons. The first reason being, lower CPU usage usually leads to better performance in a program, second the less CPU usage one program has, the more programs can be run at the same time. All of these things are specifically important when programming for a mobile device. Currently mobile devices are very limited in memory, energy, and processing power. At the moment, even top of the line devices only have a battery capacity of around 3500mAh. This makes taking into account the energy efficiency very important because everyone wants their phone battery to last as long as possible, and if your app is draining someone's battery very quickly, they will be more likely to not use the app as much or even going so far as deleting the app.
