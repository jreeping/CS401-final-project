Electricity vs Efficiency in Programming

Being able to see which programming languages are the most efficient can come in handy when you are targeting programming for a device which lacks in one of the 3 categories that was tested, whether that is energy, memory, or processing power. For example, if you were programming for use on a raspberry pi, you might want to use the C language which is in the Top 3 in energy efficiency, processing efficiency, and memory efficiency. All 3 of these things are lacking on the raspberry pi making knowing which language to use pivotal in how well your program will run a device like the raspberry pi. This applies to all devices and all different PC setups. Every PC is lacking in a certain area or trying to push the bounds of performance. This is one of the reasons that most game developers choose to use C++ or C# to develop their games, because they are some of the most efficient in terms of power and processing efficiency while at the same time having sufficient libraries for game development.
